This is the tutorial I used for this code


information for the sign in project:

https://github.com/susmitaadhikari2006/GITHUB/blob/main/log_in/ChangePassword.py

use signup.py to create an store your account information
use changePassword.py to log in and change your password
and you will need the user.csv and hashed.csv
user.csv --> stores only username and raw unhased password just for the sake of this project
hashed,csv --> stores username, hashedpassword, salt, and pepper

please be patient with the project it takes some time to hash and passwords and check information

to start the project make sure you have Python 3.12.1 and you are in the correct repository
run "python FileName.py" in the terminal
